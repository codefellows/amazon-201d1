# Assignment Overview: Lab 11

Your savvy marketing person has just informed you that just showing users the numbered data of the click percentages is not going to cut it.
You need a visual representation to grab the user's attention.

### New Bus Mall Technical Goal

- Start today's work on a branch called `chartjs`.

- Using ChartJS, display your vote totals in a bar chart as instructed in the initial definition of the BusMall assignment. If you want to try some additional chart types, do so with some of your alternate data that you have calculated from your vote results. The size and look of your chart is up to you, just be sure to put it in the area beneath the three images. Hint: for this type of data, bar charts work well.

### Oh Wait - A New Requirement!

Marketing has gotten a lot of negative feedback from users who want to store their results, so that when they refresh the page, *or even if they leave their browser and return later* they can still see their data from before.

### Time to Add Persistence!

- Complete today's work on a branch called `local-storage`.

- Give your BusMall app some persistence by using local storage to store your voting data! The goal is to have all of your click data persist through a page refresh or through completely closing the browser.
